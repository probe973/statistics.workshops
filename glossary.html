                    <li>These error bars commonly represent the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM), indicating how much the sample mean is likely to vary from the true population mean. A smaller SEM suggests a more precise estimate of the population mean.</li>
                    <li>They can also represent the Standard Deviation (SD), showing the typical amount of variation or dispersion of individual data points around the mean.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, error bars can represent a Confidence Interval (e.g., 95% CI), which provides a range within which the true population mean is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The shape of a dataset (e.g., normal, skewed, bimodal).</li>

        <h2 id="types-of-data">Types of Data</h2>
        <p>Understanding the different types of data is fundamental in statistics, as it dictates which statistical analyses and visualizations are appropriate. Data can be broadly categorized into qualitative (categorical) and quantitative (numerical) types, with further subdivisions based on their measurement properties.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Nominal Data</strong></dt>
            <dd>Categorical data where categories have no inherent order or ranking. They are simply labels used to classify observations. Examples include gender (Male, Female, Non-binary), marital status (Single, Married, Divorced), or preferred study method (Flashcards, Summarizing, Practice Tests).</dd>

            <dt><strong>Ordinal Data</strong></dt>
            <dd>Categorical data where categories have a meaningful order or ranking, but the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal or meaningful. Examples include Likert scales (e.g., Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree), educational levels (High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD), or satisfaction ratings (Low, Medium, High).</dd>

            <dt><strong>Interval Data</strong></dt>
            <dd>Numerical data where the order and the differences between values are meaningful, but there is no true or absolute zero point. This means that a value of zero does not indicate the complete absence of the quantity. Examples include temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0°C does not mean no temperature), or IQ scores.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Ratio Data</strong></dt>
            <dd>Numerical data where the order, differences, and ratios between values are all meaningful, and there is a true or absolute zero point. A value of zero indicates the complete absence of the quantity. Examples include height, weight, age, income, number of hours studied, or exam scores. Because of the true zero, ratio comparisons are valid (e.g., 20 hours is twice as long as 10 hours).</dd>

        <h2 id="key-terms-inferential-tests">Key Terms for Inferential Tests</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Parametric Tests</strong></dt>
            <dd>Statistical tests that make specific assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution from which the sample data are drawn. These often include assumptions about the shape of the distribution (e.g., normality) and the equality of variances. Parametric tests are generally more powerful (better at detecting a true effect) when their assumptions are met.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Non-Parametric Tests</strong></dt>
            <dd>Statistical tests that do not rely on specific assumptions about the parameters or shape of the population distribution. They are often used when data is ordinal, when the sample size is small and normality cannot be assumed, or when the data is severely skewed or has outliers that violate parametric assumptions. While generally less powerful than parametric tests, they are more robust to violations of assumptions.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Normality (Approximate Normality)</strong></dt>
            <dd>Refers to whether the distribution of your data (or the residuals in regression, or the differences in paired tests) resembles a bell-shaped curve (normal distribution). Many parametric tests assume that the data they analyze are drawn from a normally distributed population. For larger sample sizes, the Central Limit Theorem often allows these tests to be robust even if the data are not perfectly normal.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Homogeneity of Variances</strong></dt>
            <dd>This assumption means that the variability (spread) of the dependent variable is roughly equal across all groups or levels of the independent variable. For example, in an Independent Samples t-test, it means the spread of scores in Group A is similar to the spread of scores in Group B.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Sphericity</strong></dt>
            <dd>A specific assumption for Repeated Measures ANOVA. It refers to the condition where the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of within-subjects conditions (e.g., Time 1 vs. Time 2, Time 1 vs. Time 3, Time 2 vs. Time 3) are equal. Violation of sphericity can lead to an increased risk of Type I error (false positive). Statistical software can test for sphericity and apply corrections if it's violated.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Independent Observations</strong></dt>
            <dd>This assumption means that the data points in your sample are unrelated to each other. The measurement for one participant should not influence, nor be influenced by, the measurement for any other participant. This is typical for between-subjects designs where different people are in different groups.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Dependent (Paired/Related) Observations</strong></dt>
            <dd>This refers to data where observations are linked or related. This often occurs when the same participants are measured multiple times (e.g., before and after an intervention), or when participants are matched into pairs (e.g., twins, or closely related individuals). The measurements within each pair or across time points are not independent.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Linear Relationship</strong></dt>
            <dd>For tests like Pearson Correlation and Linear Regression, this assumption means that the relationship between two variables can be best described by a straight line. If you plot the data, the points should generally follow a linear pattern.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Monotonic Relationship</strong></dt>
            <dd>A relationship where as one variable increases, the other variable either consistently increases or consistently decreases, but not necessarily at a constant rate (i.e., not necessarily a straight line). This is a less strict assumption than a linear relationship and is relevant for non-parametric correlations like Spearman's.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Residuals</strong></dt>
            <dd>In regression analysis, residuals are the differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the regression model. They represent the "error" in the model's prediction for each observation.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Residuals)</strong></dt>
            <dd>An assumption in linear regression that the variance of the residuals (the errors in prediction) is constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). Visually, this means the spread of residuals should look roughly even across the range of predicted values.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Multicollinearity</strong></dt>
            <dd>Occurs in regression analysis when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, and can lead to unstable regression coefficients.</dd>

        <h2 id="checking-assumptions-follow-up">Checking Assumptions and Performing Follow-Up Tests for Common Inferential Tests</h2>
        <p>Before conducting an inferential statistical test, it's crucial to check if your data meets the test's underlying assumptions. Violating these assumptions can lead to inaccurate results and conclusions. After some tests, if a significant result is found, you may need to perform 'follow-up' or 'post-hoc' tests to pinpoint exactly where the differences lie. Remember to refer to the specific software guides (jamovi, R, SPSS, Stata) for detailed instructions on how to perform these checks and tests.</p>

        <h3>Independent Samples t-test</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Assumptions to Check:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independence of Observations:</strong> Ensure that the participants in one group are completely unrelated to those in the other group (e.g., different people in each group). This is a design assumption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The dependent (outcome) variable should be approximately normally distributed within each of the two independent groups.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> You can visually inspect histograms and Q-Q plots for each group. For smaller sample sizes (e.g., less than 50 per group), statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test can be used (a non-significant p-value, typically p > .05, suggests normality).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variances:</strong> The spread of scores (variances) for the dependent variable should be roughly equal in both groups.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Use Levene's Test (a non-significant p-value, typically p > .05, suggests equal variances). If Levene's Test is significant, it means variances are unequal, and you should use the Welch's t-test result (which corrects for unequal variances) instead of the standard Independent Samples t-test.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Follow-Up Tests:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Not needed. The Independent Samples t-test directly compares only two groups, so no further tests are required to pinpoint differences.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Paired Samples t-test</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Assumptions to Check:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independence of Observations (between pairs):</strong> While the two measurements within each participant are dependent, each pair of observations (e.g., Participant 1's pre-test and post-test scores) should be independent of other pairs (e.g., Participant 2's scores). This is a design assumption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Normality of Differences:</strong> The distribution of the <strong>differences</strong> between the two paired measurements should be approximately normally distributed.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Calculate the difference score for each participant (e.g., Post-test - Pre-test). Then, visually inspect a histogram and Q-Q plot of these difference scores. For smaller sample sizes, the Shapiro-Wilk test on the difference scores can be used.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Follow-Up Tests:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Not needed. The Paired Samples t-test directly compares only two related measurements, so no further tests are required.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>One-Way ANOVA</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Assumptions to Check:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independence of Observations:</strong> Ensure participants in one group are completely unrelated to those in other groups. This is a design assumption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The dependent (outcome) variable should be approximately normally distributed within each of the groups.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Visually inspect histograms and Q-Q plots for each group separately. For smaller sample sizes per group, the Shapiro-Wilk test can be run for each group.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variances:</strong> The spread of scores (variances) for the dependent variable should be roughly equal across all groups.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Use Levene's Test (a non-significant p-value, typically p > .05, suggests equal variances). If Levene's Test is significant, you may consider using Welch's ANOVA (if available in your software) or a non-parametric alternative like the Kruskal-Wallis H Test.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt><strong>Follow-Up Tests:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Needed if the One-Way ANOVA is statistically significant (p < .05). These tests, often called post-hoc tests, help you determine <strong>which specific group means</strong> are different from each other, as the ANOVA only tells you that <strong>at least one</strong> difference exists among the multiple groups.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common Post-Hoc Tests:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference):</strong> A popular choice for comparing all possible pairs of means when homogeneity of variances is met.</li>
                            <li><strong>Games-Howell Post-Hoc Test:</strong> Recommended when the assumption of homogeneity of variances is violated (i.e., Levene's test is significant).</li>
                            <li><strong>Bonferroni Correction:</strong> A more conservative adjustment that can be applied to individual pairwise comparisons, reducing the chance of Type I error but potentially increasing Type II error.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>When Not Needed:</strong> If the overall One-Way ANOVA is not statistically significant, or if you only have two groups (in which case you would use an Independent Samples t-test instead).</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Repeated Measures ANOVA</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Assumptions to Check:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Independence of Observations (between subjects):</strong> Each participant's data should be independent of other participants' data. This is a design assumption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Normality:</strong> The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed for each repeated measure (e.g., at each time point or condition).
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Visually inspect histograms and Q-Q plots for the dependent variable at each measurement point.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sphericity:</strong> This is a specific and important assumption for Repeated Measures ANOVA. It means that the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of within-subjects conditions (e.g., Time 1 vs. Time 2, Time 1 vs. Time 3, Time 2 vs. Time 3) are equal.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Use Mauchly's Test of Sphericity (a non-significant p-value, typically p > .05, suggests sphericity is met). If Mauchly's Test is significant, it indicates a violation of sphericity. Statistical software will automatically provide corrected p-values (e.g., Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt corrections) which should be used instead.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <dt><strong>Follow-Up Tests:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Needed if the Repeated Measures ANOVA for the within-subjects factor is statistically significant (p < .05). These tests help identify <strong>which specific repeated measures</strong> differ from each other.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Common Post-Hoc Tests:</strong> Often, pairwise comparisons using Paired Samples t-tests with a Bonferroni correction are performed. Some software also offers specific post-hoc tests for repeated measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>When Not Needed:</strong> If the overall within-subjects effect is not statistically significant, or if you only have two repeated measures (in which case you would use a Paired Samples t-test instead).</li>

        <h3>Linear Regression (Simple and Multiple)</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Assumptions to Check:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linearity:</strong> The relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable should be linear.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Create scatter plots of the dependent variable against each independent variable. Also, plot the residuals against the predicted values; there should be no clear pattern (e.g., curved, U-shaped).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Independence of Observations:</strong> Each observation (data point) in your dataset should be independent of all other observations. This is a design assumption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Normality of Residuals:</strong> The errors (residuals) of the regression model should be approximately normally distributed.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Examine a histogram of the residuals and a Q-Q plot of the residuals. The histogram should look roughly bell-shaped, and the points on the Q-Q plot should fall close to the diagonal line.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Residuals):</strong> The variance (spread) of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s) and across the range of predicted values.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Plot the residuals against the predicted values. The spread of the residuals should look roughly even across the plot, without fanning out or narrowing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Low Multicollinearity (for Multiple Regression):</strong> In multiple regression, independent variables should not be too highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity makes it difficult to determine the unique contribution of each predictor.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How to Check:</strong> Calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for each independent variable. VIF values typically below 5 or 10 (depending on guidelines) are generally acceptable.</li>
                        </ul>

            <dd>
                Not applicable in the same way as ANOVA. Regression analysis focuses on the overall model fit and the individual contributions (coefficients) of each predictor. Further investigation typically involves examining the significance of individual coefficients, their confidence intervals, and the overall predictive power of the model.
